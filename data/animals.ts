They can range from 3-5 inches in length with fringed scales along their sides. They prefer desert to semidesert areas. Their diet mainly consists of ants which they capture with a sticky tongue. Their coloring helps camouflage them to blend in with their surroundings. When threatened, they can puff up, making themselves appear larger and more difficult to swallow. Another defensive mechanism is their ability to squirt blood, which has some toxic chemicals giving it an unpleasant taste. Horned toad lizards give birth to live young."
